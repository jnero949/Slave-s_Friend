                  <p>Did you ever know, Papa, that slaves were sold by the pound before Mr. Birney
                     wrote that letter?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Papa.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly I did. Did you never hear that before?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Charles.</speaker>
                  <p> What, sell boys and girls, like Julia and me, as they do pigs and fish! Is it
                     so, father? Tell us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Papa.</speaker>
                  <p>It is indeed true, my son. If you will look into Mr. Bourne's book, <hi
                        rend="caps">Picture of Slavery, </hi> you will see some slaves weighing a
                     little girl in a pair of scales.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Charles.</speaker>
                  <p>How much will she weigh?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Papa.</speaker>
                  <p>I suppose about fifty pounds.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Charles.</speaker>
                  <p>How much do they get a pound for the poor slaves?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Papa.</speaker>
                  <p>Four dollars, and sometimes five: If that little girl weighted fifty pounds,
                     and her master got four dollars a pound for her, she was sold for two hundred
                     dollars.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Charles.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah! That's the reason they dont want to emancipate the slaves; they get so much
                     money by selling them: Isn't it so, farther?</p>

               <stage>A white man, whose name was Lorenzo, once teased a poor colored man, whose
                  name was Mungo.</stage>

                  <p>Here, Mungo, said he, look at this apple, and then look at that chestnut.</p>

                  <speaker rend="italics">Lorenzo.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, this apple is the white man, and that chestnut is the negro.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Mungo.</speaker>
                  <p>O, Massa, what you say is true. The chestnut has a dark skin, just like poor
                     black man. But its <hi rend="italics">kernel</hi>is all white, and sweet. The
                     apple, though it looks so pretty, has many little black grains at the
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>Now little boys and girls can't be abolitionists until they get rid of all
                     these black grains in their hearts. And they can't be good while they have such
                     wicked eharts. Jesus will not love them who hate the poor negro, or hate
                     God.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker rend="italics">Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>These three children lived with their father and mother, in Africa, about a
                     mile from the sea side. They were as free as the little birds whose voices they
                     heard from the topmost boughs of cocoa treel they loved dearly to run in the
                     woods, chase butterflies, gather wild flowers, and dress themselves with the
                     palm leafs. One day their mother sent them to get some yams, (like our
                     potatoes;) they took their baskets and went, little thinking they were to see
                     their parents no more. As they were digging yams, the youngest boy looked up
                     and said, "O sister, what is that?" She replied, "I do not know," for she had
                     never seen a white man before. The men showed them beads and other trinkets.
                     while the children were looking at them, these men-thieves came behind them and
                     stuck plasters over tehir mouths. Then they caught them up and ran with them to
                     the boat, that soon took them to the horrid slave ship.</p>

                  <speaker rend="italics">Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>No, because their mouths were covered with the plasters.</p>

                  <speaker rend="italics">Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my son, the love of money makes men so. Do you remember that good Mary Ann
                     who used to live with us?</p>

                  <p>Well, one of these boys was her father. How much he suffered in the slave ship,
                     and after he got to America, I must tell you some other time.</p>

                  <p>I will tell you. He, and his parents, had been slaves. His father had run away,
                     and took Henry with him. Mr. Wright went to the prison to see them. He asked
                     the judge to let him take Henry home with him.</p>

                  <p>Yes, but he made Mr. Wright promise to bring him back next day. Poor Henry was
                     so afraid that he could hardly fall asleep. He would speak out in his dream, "I
                     wont go. I wont go."</p>

                  <p>Yes, Mary. He is free now, and at school in the country somewhere. Instead of
                     being brought up like a beast, he will, I hope, be a good scholar, and pergaps
                     a minsiter! An't you glad, sister Mary?</p>

                  <p>I know him. Papa said he went into his evening school, and saw them writing,
                     ciphering, and studying. They looked very happy. Now I think of it, don't they

                  <p>Because people have felt that the colored people among us were foreigners. They
                     might just as well call our school-house, "the English or Irish School,"
                     because our great grandfathers came from England and Ireland. </p>

                     Travellers are suprised to see the Africans calculate, in their heads, so well
                     as they do. They say we cannot reckon so well.</p>

                  <p>It shows that some of them have more. And I want to tell you, my son, and all
                     my little readers, that it is very rash, and very offensive to God, for white
                     people to think he has made them superior to black people. If the colored

                     them. This has always been the case. </p>

                     would have him. A few Sabbaths after James had learned this command, his mother
                     put some coffee into the coffee-mill, and told him to grind it for breakfast.
                     James took the mill and began to turn; but soon he almost stopped, and seemed
                     thinking of something. His sister seeing this, said, 'Ma, shall I grind the
                     coffee for you?' After a moment, her mother said, 'Yes, I guess you must; James
                     is lazy this morning.' James looked mildly on his mother, with a tear in his
                     eye, and said, 'Ma, did I not split wood for you, yesterday?' 'Yes, James; but
                     that has nothing to do with grinding the coffee, <hi rend="italics">this
                        morning.'</hi> 'Well, Ma, is not this the Sabbath?' 'Yes.' Then James said
                     to his mother, 'The commandment says, Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it
                     holy. On it thou shalt not do <hi rend="italics">any work;</hi> and now, Ma,
                     ought I to grind the coffee?' His mother was surprised. James set the mill down
                     on the floor. Then his mother said, 'Well, James, you need not grind the

                     went to another part of the room, where James could not see him. James asked
                     his mother if the doctor had gone. When he was told he had not, 'Well,' said
                     he, 'I want to see him.' The doctor came to the bed-side, and said, 'What do

                     Nazareth and preached, the wicked peple of that day "were filled with wrath,
                     and rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow, or edge
                     of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down

                  <p>Judas came with a mob to take Jesus. The holy Savior went into a garden, in the
                     evening, with his disciples, to pray. Judas came upon him with "a great
                     multitude with swords and staves, and lanterns and torches." He had told them
                     the truth, and they would not bear it. They did not want to give up their sins.
                     So they took him and put him to death.</p>

                     angry, came upon him, caught him, and told lies about him. "They were cut to
                     the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth." Soon "they cried out with
                     a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and
                     cast him out of the city, and stoned him."</p>

                  <speaker rend="italics">Mr. Snow.</speaker>
                  <p>He was born in Asia, nearly 600 years before Christ. He was deformed, and a slave. His nose was flat, his lips were thick, and his skin was dark. He used to say, when any one asked him where he was born,"I am a negro." <stage>[See Aesop's Life]</stage></p>

                  <p>Aesop a slave, father! I did not know that before.</p>

                  <p>He was, my son. But he had a fine mind; one of his masters had him taught Greek. And Aesop told one he must not look at the color of his skin, but at his mind.</p>

                  <p>That was a very pretty remark, wasn't it papa? It seems then they let slaves learn to read in old times.</p>

                  <p>Yes, no slaves but American slaves have been denied books. How I blush for America! Aesop composed his fables to soften the hardship of being a slave. Learning did not hurt him, you see; and it will not hurt any one. On the cover of the Slave's Friend, it is said, <hi rend="italics">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge.</hi> This is from the Bible. This precious book says also, <hi rend="italics">Fools hate knowledge.</hi></p>

                  <p>A <hi rend="italics">thief</hi> is one that takes what is not his own by stealth, that is, secretly. A <hi rend="indent">robber</hi> is one that plunders by force.</p>

                  <p>Both, I think. He takes men, women, and children, <hi rend="italics">by stealth, and by force.</hi> In Exodus 21:16, it is said, "And he that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death." Man-stealing, in those days, you see, was considered a very great crime. the apostle Paul, in 1 Tim. 1:10, says, "The Law is made for men-stealers." Stealers of men are all those who bring off slaves or freemen, an keep, sell, or buy them. Bishop Horsely said, "We have reason to conclude, from the mention made of 'slave-traders' or 'men-stealers' by the apostle Paul, that if any of them should ever find their way to heaven, they must go thither in company with murderers and parricides."*</p>

               <lg type="poem">
                  <l>Dear white young master, hear, I pray,</l>
                  <l>What your poor black boy aims to say.</l>
                  <l>I often wonder why should be</l>
                  <l>Such difference betwixt you and me;</l>
                  <l>For I’m as tall and strong as you,</l>
                  <l>And many things as well can do;</l>
                  <l>Can feel and see, can hear and talk.</l>
                  <l>‘Tis true I am not nice of speech;</l>
                  <l>For who poor simple black will teach?</l>
                  <l>For me to labor, dig and hoe,</l>
                  <l>Is all that I am like to know;</l>
                  <l>But you have teachers every day,</l>
                  <l>And much you learn, at least you may;</l>
                  <l>They teach you to be good and wise,</l>
                  <l>But my hard lot this boon denies.</l>
                  <l>Dear, good young master, pray attend;</l>
                  <l>You can poor friendless black befriend;</l>
                  <l>Neglected, ignorant, and rude,</l>
                  <l>I fain would learn, would fain be good;</l>
                  <l>Oh teach me part of what you know,</l>
                  <l>You will not lose what you bestow;</l>
                  <l>And if a slave I still must be,</l>
                  <l>Oh let my mind at least be free.</l>
                  <l>I heard your kind mamma one day</l>
                  <l>A little lesson bid you say;</l>
                  <l>She bid you fix it in your heart,</l>
                  <l>Nor ever from its law depart;</l>
                  <l>“Be you to others kinda nd true,</l>
                  <l>As you’d have others be to you.”</l>
                  <l>As you repeated what she taught,</l>
                  <l>My ear, my heart, the lesson caught;</l>
                  <l>And will he make this rule his guide?</l>
                  <l>“He will–he must”—my heart replied;</l>
                  <l>And oh! what joy to all my race,</l>
                  <l>When all ofo his this rule embrace!</l>
                  <l>Now, dear young master, what would you,</l>
                  <l>Were our lots changed, wish me to do?</l>

                  <speaker rend="italics">Rufus.</speaker>
                  <p>I heard that the collector of New York had seized that brig, just as she was ready for sea, and that the captain and part of the crew had been taken before the United States Judge. What made them think it was a slaver?</p>

                  <speaker rend="italics">Seth.</speaker>
                  <p>She was built very sharp, so as to sail fast, and take but little cargo. That shows she was not intended for a merchant ship. The English ships of war cruise on the coast of Africa, and they will capture slave ships if they do not sail very fast. Then she had large water tanks that would hold upwards of one hundred and twenty gallons of water each. This shows that they expected to have a large number of people on board to drink this water. Merchant vessels take water in casks. There were also cannon, muskets, cutlasses, and pistols on board.</p>

                  <p>If she had been either they would have shown their commision. Besides, there were iron-gratings for the hatchways.</p>

                  <p>They put them over the hatchway so that light and air can go down into the hold of the vessel and the slaves can still be kept from escaping. Slave vessels always have them. And the witnesses who had seen slave-vessels had no doubt from her general appearance that this brig was one. The cargo consisted of such goods as the slave-traders take to Africa to exchange for slaves. There were, beside other articles, twenty-five boxes of muskets, and five hundred kegs of powder! They can buy a slave in Africa for a musket or a flask of gunpowder.</p>

But two of them, who were Italians, had told a few days before, that they were going to Africa “after n—” and when they had brought them to the island of Cuba, they were going to sell them. So the Judge sent these two sailors to prison, and they will be tried, and as there was not evidence enough to commit the rest they were set at liberty.</p>

                  <p>The vessel will be <hi rend="italics">confiscated,</hi> that is taken from them; besides they will have to pay a large fine, and be put in prison. Now, Rufus, what will you say when I tell you this brig was built at Baltimore, and that people in this country join with wicked men of other nations, in fitting out vessels for the slave-trade, every year?</p>

                  <p>What will I say? Why, that it is a disgrace to this country, and a horrible wickedness in the sight of God. I read the other day about these wicked brokers in the trade of blood, who buy, and sell, and steal, for gold.</p>

                  <p>I have read also what <hi rend="italics">Jonathan Edwards</hi> said, forty-three years ago, – “To steal a man, or to rob him of his liberty, is a greater sin than to steal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a state of slavery, who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of man-stealing.” I wish that all ministers, nowadays, would preach the truth so faithfully. Then, as your father said yesterday, slavery would soon come to an end; and when there is no slavery there will be no slave-trade.</p>
