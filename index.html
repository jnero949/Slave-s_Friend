    <p>Issues of justice affect everyone – and children are no different. In the early nineteenth century, abolitionists worked to encourage young people to join the fight against slavery and the injustices against black people in America. One way in which they did this was through a children’s magazine entitled Slave’s Friend. This periodical was filled with anti-slavery rhetoric, featuring poems, prayers, short stories, and brief general news for children to read. The magazine was created by the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1835 (the first edition getting published in 1836) where they raised $30,000 to create a series of publications to spread the anti-slavery message across America. The magazine was offered through both subscription and for free via mail and reached high levels of circulation with an average of about 10,000 copies per issue. While the main objective of the magazine was to encourage a new generation of abolitionists, it also contained general lessons that many children’s stories focus on like “the golden rule” or respecting one’s parents, which aligns with their target audience of six to twelve year olds. The magazine advocated for nonviolent approaches to abolition and promoted the equal treatment of black people among both white and black children. Not only did this magazine share stories (fictional and factual), but it also inspired action by instructing children to boycott certain slave-made food products, spreading the word through the innocent mouths of the youth. These are only a few of the numerous things this publication encouraged throughout its thirty-eight issues.</p>
   <p>In this edition I decided to cover all the poems and plays from a selection of editions – primarily the first twelve. I decided to do these two formats as I believed they were the most interesting. Children are often told stories and fables to teach them moral lessons, but by communicating these messages through differing formats creates a different impact upon the children reading them. Provided with more time, I would have attempted to transcribe the entire editions to have a fully accessible version of these underrepresented texts available for researchers and intellectuals, however I transcribed the most I could with the given time. In future I hope to continue working on this project, adding to the pages more than just the poems and plays, adding images of the given text, creating more annotations, and making the website more user friendly by adding a navigation bar, index, etc. There is still much work to do on this project, however, I believe this edition paints a fair picture on the content of The Slave’s Friend as it exists in its current form. </p>

     <p class="p-in-sp">How much do they get a pound for the poor slaves?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Papa.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Four dollars, and sometimes five: If that little girl weighted fifty pounds,
      and her master got four dollars a pound for her, she was sold for two hundred dollars.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Charles.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Ah! That's the reason they dont want to emancipate the slaves; they get so
      much money by selling them: Isn't it so, father?</p>
      <note xml:id="N1">Picture of Slavery was a book written by George Bourne which was seen as a book from 1834 which was perceived as radical for its demands for “immediate, unconditional, and universal emancipation” without compensation for slave owners. Bourne was a firm believer in abolition, believing it was ungodly to hold slaves and that it was the stealing of men and women that was unforgivable. He used his religious background to predicate many of his beliefs regarding slavery and appealed to the religious zealots by using biblical verses and language to raise spirits for abolitionists.

     <div class="speaker">Mother.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">These three children lived with their father and mother, in Africa, about a
      mile from the sea side. They were as free as the little birds whose voices they heard from the
      topmost boughs of cocoa treel they loved dearly to run in the woods, chase butterflies, gather
      wild flowers, and dress themselves with the palm leafs. One day their mother sent them to get
      some yams, (like our potatoes;) they took their baskets and went, little thinking they were to
      see their parents no more. As they were digging yams, the youngest boy looked up and said, "O
      sister, what is that?" She replied, "I do not know," for she had never seen a white man
      before. The men showed them <ref target="N3">beads and other trinkets.</ref> while the children were looking at them,
      these men-thieves came behind them and stuck plasters over tehir mouths. Then they caught them
      up and ran with them to the boat, that soon took them to the horrid slave ship.</p>
     <div class="speaker">John.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">O how very wicked, but could not the children cry?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mother.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">No, because their mouths were covered with the plasters.</p>
     <div class="speaker">John.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Mother, I did not think it possible for any one to be so cruel?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mother.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Yes, my son, the love of money makes men so. Do you remember that good Mary
      Ann who used to live with us?</p>
     <div class="speaker">John.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Yes indeed I do.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mother.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Well, one of these boys was her father. How much he suffered in the slave
      ship, and after he got to America, I must tell you some other time.</p>
      <note xml:id="N2">This hymn was published in a pamphlet similar to The Slave’s Friend entitled  Hymns for Children which was a small leaflet compendium of select poems to educate children and raise abolition efforts. The hymn mentioned in this section is the first in the pamphlet actually entitled “A child’s hymn of praise” reading: I thank the goodness and the grace / which on my birth have smil’d, / and made me in these Christian days, / A free and happy child. / I was not born, as thousands are, / Where God was never known; / And taught to pray a useless prayer / To blocks of wood and stone. / I was not born a little slave, / To labour in the sun, / And wish I were but in the grave / And all my labour done! / I was not born without a home, / Or in some broken shed; / A gipsy baby, taught to roam, / And steal my daily bread. / My God, I thank thee, who has plann’d / A better lot for me, / And plac’d me in this happy land, / And where I hear of thee.”

<note xml:id="N3">For multiple centuries black bodies were carried from the western coast of Africa to numerous European countries and America. They were piled into slave ships with virtually no regard for their well-being or their survivability, sometimes casting black people overboard to “make room” or to save resources. There were many ways in which enslaved peoples were stolen from their land by both Europeans and African traders, oftentimes with Europeans offering to sell goods like textiles, weaponry, iron, etc. for slaves that they could later sell when returning to America or other European colonies.

      <note xml:id="N4">Enslaved people often turned to religion as a form of escapism from the horrors they witnessed in their day to day lives. Despite their turmoil, many black people in the United States were devoutly religious and saw Christianity as a source of hope and enlightenment. During the 1830s and onward there was a large movement for more religious instruction and teaching given to slaves. This movement was forged by white, religious slave owners because, according to the clergy, the Bible instructed them that it was their duty to spread the word of the Lord to save them from “powerful temptations.” It is also said that this was necessary because slaves had souls and therefore could be subject to eternal damnation in the Christian view if they were not devout and faithful Christians which is interesting to note due to the abhorrent treatment from enslavers towards African Americans during this time.

     <p class="p-in-sp">No. What did they do that for?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Elizabeth.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">I will tell you. He, and his parents, had been slaves. His father had run
      away, and took Henry with him. Mr. Wright went to the prison to see them. He asked the judge
      to let him take Henry home with him.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mary.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Did he let him go?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Elizabeth.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Yes, but he made Mr. Wright promise to bring him back next day. Poor Henry
      was so afraid that he could hardly fall asleep. He would speak out in his dream, "I wont go. I
      wont go."</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mary.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">O, he is hte boy so many children gave their pennies to have set free. Isn't
      he?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Elizabeth.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Yes, Mary. He is free now, and at school in the country somewhere. Instead
      of being brought up like a beast, he will, I hope, be a good scholar, and pergaps a minsiter!
      An't you glad, sister Mary?</p>
      <note xml:id="N5">Henry Scott was a half white, half black man who was enslaved and fought for his freedom. When he was fourteen, he met Sergeant Loring W. Muzzey who taught Scott how to read and write, as well as the rest of his regiment. In addition to Muzzey and his troupe, Muzzey’s mother sent Scott a bible which he read and later in life joined the Baptist church with the encouragement of Muzzey and his mother. Later, he became a teacher, minister, and bookstore owner, becoming politiaclly active years later and fought for equal rights. He was one of the original 29 members of the Niagara Movement — serving as a precursor to the National Advancement of Colored People and later on the Civil Rights Movement. Scott died from tuberculosis at the age of sixty two a few months after his mentor Muzzey died.

The next being from Acts 10:34 amidst a revelation Peter had about God’s impartiality, accepting all individuals despite their nationality or ethnicity as long as they believe in him. The last quotation is from Exodus 21:16 in which God speaks of the enslaved people in Israel, explaining that anyone who steals a person should be put to death.

     <p class="p-in-sp">I thought, father, you did not mean to have such long words in the Slave's
      Friend.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">I can not always help it. If you find any word you do not understand, you
      must ask the meaning of it.</p>
     <div class="speaker">James.</div>

     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">It means those who study arithmetic, my son.</p>
     <div class="speaker">James.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Is that all? Why, father, I'm ashamed that I asked you such a question. The
      word <span class="italics">looked</span> so long, I did no tthink I knew what it meant.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">I want to tell you something about mental arithmetic. It is to reckon <span
       class="italics">in your head.</span> Cyphering, you know, is to do it with a <span
       class="italics">slate,</span> or <span class="italics">pen and ink.</span> The Africans
      reckon in their heads. Their money is a kind of shell. They are called <ref target="N7"><span class="italics"
       >cowries.</span></ref> It takes a great many to make a small sum. Travellers are suprised to see
      the Africans calculate, in their heads, so well as they do. They say we cannot reckon so
      well.</p>
     <div class="speaker">James.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Dont that show that the blacks have as much sense as we have?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">It shows that some of them have more. And I want to tell you, my son, and
      all my little readers, that it is very rash, and very offensive to God, for white people to
      think he has made them superior to black people. If the colored people only had the same
      advantages the whites have, they would be equal to them. This has always been the case. </p>
      <note xml:id="N7">Cowrie shells were a vital part of African Culture as symbols of wealth, power, fertility, and protection. They could be used to purchase things such as tools and groceries or pay taxes or laborers. The earliest known use of cowrie shells is from the 7th century BCE in China with the earliest existence of the shell in West Africa appearing in the 14th century. The shells belonged to snails and, to make them into a form of currency, workers – typically women – worked to clean them with seawater and freshwater to make them ready to be used. Oftentimes enslaved people were given a quote based in cowrie shells which was ever-increasing during the transatlantic slave trade.</note>

      love Miss Susan Paul, for writing it. James was a good boy, wasn't he?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Papa.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">A very good boy. And he was not seven years old, Charles, when he died.</p>

     <p class="p-in-sp">"James thought he should be glad to keep the holy Sabbath, just as the Lord
      would have him. A few Sabbaths after James had learned this command, his mother put some
      coffee into the coffee-mill, and told him to grind it for breakfast. James took the mill and
      began to turn; but soon he almost stopped, and seemed thinking of something. His sister seeing
      this, said, 'Ma, shall I grind the coffee for you?' After a moment, her mother said, 'Yes, I
      guess you must; James is lazy this morning.' James looked mildly on his mother, with a tear in
      his eye, and said, 'Ma, did I not split wood for you, yesterday?' 'Yes, James; but that has
      nothing to do with grinding the coffee, <span class="italics">this morning.'</span> 'Well, Ma,
      is not this the Sabbath?' 'Yes.' Then James said to his mother, 'The commandment says,
      Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. On it thou shalt not do <span class="italics">any
       work;</span> and now, Ma, ought I to grind the coffee?' His mother was surprised. James set
      the mill down on the floor. Then his mother said, 'Well, James, you need not grind the
      coffee.'"</p>

     <p class="p-in-sp"> "While he was in great pain, the physician came in; and after standing a
      few moments by his bed-side, he went to another part of the room, where James could not see
      him. James asked his mother if the doctor had gone. When he was told he had not, 'Well,' said
      he, 'I want to see him.' The doctor came to the bed-side, and said, 'What do you want, James?'
      He replied, 'I want to know if you <span class="italics">love God, my Saviour?'</span> 'What
      do you say, James?' said the doctor. James repeated, with as much strength as he could, 'Do
      you know God, my Saviour?' The doctor, as he turned his face from the little sufferer, said,
       <span class="italics">'That is a happy child.'</span>"</p>
       <note xml:id="N8">Originally published in 1835. Susan Paul – an African American abolitionist from Boston, Massachusetts – wrote The Memoir of James ackson, The Attentive and Obedient Scholar, Who Died in Boston, October 31, 1833, Aged Six Years and Eleven Months, which was approximately 200 pages detailing the unfortunately short life of James Jackson who was a student of Paul’s. This document is hailed as the first African American biography combines eyewitness accounts, personal testimony, and excerpts from religious texts, telling the story of a young boy who was described in the most simplest of terms as “good.”</note>

     <div class="speaker">Ellen.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Father, what is the meaning of the word <span class="italics">mob?</span> I
      don't find it in the Bible.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">I suppose not, but there are many mobs spoken of in the Bible, though under
      some other name. the word means a parcel of men and boys got together to do mischief.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Ellen.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Do tell me about the mobs in the Bible.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">I will, my child, just mention a few out of a great many. When Jesus went to
      Nazareth and preached, the wicked peple of that day "were filled with wrath, and rose up, and
      thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow, or edge of the hill whereon their city
      was built, that they might cast him down headlong."</p>
     <div class="speaker">Ellen.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Why did they do so, dear father?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Because Jesus told them of their sins so plainly.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Ellen.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Will you tell me of another mob?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Judas came with a mob to take Jesus. The holy Savior went into a garden, in
      the evening, with his disciples, to pray. Judas came upon him with "a great multitude with
      swords and staves, and lanterns and torches." He had told them the truth, and they would not
      bear it. They did not want to give up their sins. So they took him and put him to death.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Ellen.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">What cruel men to murder the dear Savior!</p>
     <div class="speaker">Father.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">I will now tell you of another mob. When Stephen preached, the people got
      angry, came upon him, caught him, and told lies about him. "They were cut to the heart, and
      they gnashed on him with their teeth." Soon "they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped
      their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned
      him."</p>

     <p class="p-in-sp">I know that, sir, but where was he born, and who was he?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mr. Snow.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">He was born in Asia, nearly 600 years before Christ. He was deformed, and a
      slave. His nose was flat, his lips were thick, and his skin was dark. He used to say, when any
      one asked him where he was born,"I am a negro." </p>
     <div class="stage it">[See Aesop's Life]</div>
     <div class="speaker">David.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Aesop a slave, father! I did not know that before.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mr. Snow.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">He was, my son. But he had a fine mind; one of his masters had him taught
      Greek. And Aesop told one he must not look at the color of his skin, but at his mind.</p>
     <div class="speaker">David.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">That was a very pretty remark, wasn't it papa? It seems then they let slaves
      learn to read in old times.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mr. Snow.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Yes, no slaves but American slaves have been <ref target="N9">denied books.</ref> How I blush for
      America! Aesop composed his fables to soften the hardship of being a slave. Learning did not
      hurt him, you see; and it will not hurt any one. On the cover of the Slave's Friend, it is
      said, <span class="italics">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge.</span> This is from the
      Bible. This precious book says also, <span class="italics">Fools hate knowledge.</span></p>
      <note xml:id="N9">American lawmakers and slave owners denied African Americans the right to read as they saw it as “the first step toward self-emancipation.” With the ability to read, enslaved peoples could begin learning and, in turn, learning ways to earn their freedom. The entirety of the United States slave system was predicated on the lack of education given to people of color in order to keep them underneath the social elite, refusing schooling, literacy, and sometimes even Sunday school. This is a large reason why we do not have as many first-hand accounts of slavery from the enslaved persons perspective as many slaves didn’t have the time nor the ability to write about their life and hardships.

       <div class="l">O come to the window, dear brother, and see,</div>
       <div class="l">What mischief was done in the night;</div>
       <div class="l">The snow has quite cover’d the nice appletree,</div>
       <div class="l">And the bushes are sprinkled with white.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">The spring in the grove is beginning to freeze,</div>
       <div class="l">The pond is hard frozen all o’er;</div>
       <div class="l">Long icicles hang in bright rows from the trees,</div>
       <div class="l">And drop in odd shapes from the door.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">The old mossy thatch, and the meadow so green,</div>
       <div class="l">Are cover’d all over with white;</div>
       <div class="l">The snowdrop and crocus no more can be seen,</div>
       <div class="l">The thick snow has covered them quite.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">And see the poor birds how they fly to and fro,</div>
       <div class="l">They’re come for their breakfast again,</div>
       <div class="l">But the little worms all are hid under the snow,</div>
       <div class="l">They hop about chirping in vain.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">Then open the window, I’ll throw them some bread,</div>
       <div class="l">I’ve some of my breakfast to spare;</div>
       <div class="l">I wish they would come to my hand to be fed,</div>
       <div class="l">But they’re all flown away in the air.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">Nay, now, pretty birds, don’t be frightened, I pray,</div>
       <div class="l">You shall not be hurt I’ll engage;</div>
       <div class="l">I’m not come to catch you and force you away,</div>
       <div class="l">And fasten you up in a cage.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">I wish you could know you’ve no cause for alarm,</div>
       <div class="l">From me you have nothing to fear;</div>

     <div class="speaker">Mr. Sherwood.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">A <span class="italics">thief</span> is one that takes what is not his own
      by stealth, that is, secretly. A <span style="text-indent: 5em">robber</span> is one that
      plunders by force.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Alfred.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">The robber then runs more danger than the thief, does he not, sir?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mr. S.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Certainly. He risks more personal danger.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Alfred.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Then it is meaner and more cowardly, to be a thief than a robber, I should
      think.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mr. S.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">It doubless is; but both are great crimes—against the laws of God and
      man.</p>
     <div class="speaker">Alfred.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Is a slave-holder a thief or a robber?</p>
     <div class="speaker">Mr. S.</div>
     <p class="p-in-sp">Both, I think. He takes men, women, and children, <span class="italics">by
       stealth, and by force.</span> In Exodus 21:16, it is said, "And he that stealeth a man and
      selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death." Man-stealing, in
      those days, you see, was considered a very great crime. the apostle Paul, in 1 Tim. 1:10,
      says, "The Law is made for men-stealers." Stealers of men are all those who bring off slaves
      or freemen, an keep, sell, or buy them. Bishop Horsely said, "We have reason to conclude, from
      the mention made of 'slave-traders' or 'men-stealers' by the apostle Paul, that if any of them
      should ever find their way to heaven, they must go thither in company with murderers and
      parricides."*</p>

      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">What Ship is that?</p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">That is not a Ship, dear brother, but a Brig. Her name is Saint
       Nicholas.</p>
      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">Is that the <span class="italics">slaver?</span></p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">She is supposed to be a slave-vessel.</p>
      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">I heard that the collector of New York had seized that brig, just as she
       was ready for sea, and that the captain and part of the crew had been taken before the United
       States Judge. What made them think it was a slaver?</p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">She was built very sharp, so as to sail fast, and take but little cargo.
       That shows she was not intended for a merchant ship. The English ships of war cruise on the
       coast of Africa, and they will capture slave ships if they do not sail very fast. Then she
       had large water tanks that would hold upwards of one hundred and twenty gallons of water
       each. This shows that they expected to have a large number of people on board to drink this
       water. Merchant vessels take water in casks. There were also cannon, muskets, cutlasses, and
       pistols on board.</p>
      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">But I heard someone say she might belong to the navy, or be a
       privateer?</p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">If she had been either they would have shown their commision. Besides,
       there were iron-gratings for the hatchways.</p>
      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">What use could they make of the gratings?</p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">They put them over the hatchway so that light and air can go down into the
       hold of the vessel and the slaves can still be kept from escaping. Slave vessels always have
       them. And the witnesses who had seen slave-vessels had no doubt from her general appearance
       that this brig was one. The cargo consisted of such goods as the slave-traders take to Africa
       to exchange for slaves. There were, beside other articles, twenty-five boxes of muskets, and
       five hundred kegs of powder! They can buy a slave in Africa for a musket or a flask of
       gunpowder.</p>
      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">O, dreadful! What wicked men! But could not they make the sailors tell
       where they were going? And what they were going for?</p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">No, they would not confess anything before the Judge. But two of them, who
       were Italians, had told a few days before, that they were going to Africa “after n—” and when
       they had brought them to the island of Cuba, they were going to sell them. So the Judge sent
       these two sailors to prison, and they will be tried, and as there was not evidence enough to
       commit the rest they were set at liberty.</p>
      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">What will be done to such people and to the brig, if the men are proved to
       be guilty?</p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">The vessel will be <span class="italics">confiscated,</span> that is taken
       from them; besides they will have to pay a large fine, and be put in prison. Now, Rufus, what
       will you say when I tell you this brig was built at Baltimore, and that people in this
       country join with wicked men of other nations, in fitting out vessels for the slave-trade,
       every year?</p>
      <div class="speaker">Rufus.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">What will I say? Why, that it is a disgrace to this country, and a horrible
       wickedness in the sight of God. I read the other day about these wicked brokers in the trade
       of blood, who buy, and sell, and steal, for gold.</p>
      <div class="speaker">Seth.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">I have read also what <span class="italics">Jonathan Edwards</span> said,
       forty-three years ago, – “To steal a man, or to rob him of his liberty, is a greater sin than
       to steal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a state of slavery,
       who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or
       of man-stealing.” I wish that all ministers, nowadays, would preach the truth so faithfully.
       Then, as your father said yesterday, slavery would soon come to an end; and when there is no
       slavery there will be no slave-trade.</p>
      <div class="speaker">James.</div>
      <p class="p-in-sp">I have just heard that the <span class="italics">St. Nicholas</span> has
       gone to sea! The grand jury have indicted the captain; but the consignees had given bonds for
       a quarter of the brig, and so away went the pirate-brig!!</p>

       <div style="text-indent: 5em" class="indented">And cure the pain;</div>
       <div class="l">But when I cry from pains severe,</div>

       <div class="l">Mine groaned, and said with sullen brow,</div>

       <div style="text-indent: 5em" class="indented">Tell, if you know;</div>
       <div class="l">Why are my woes and joys as nought,</div>
       <div class="l">With careful love your’s shunned or sought</div>

      </div>
      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">My own dear mother, it is true,</div>

       <div class="l">Why must that one be sent away,</div>

       <div class="l">I think as much as I she mourns,</div>

       <div class="l">One day I saw my mother weep,</div>

       <div class="l">Not for herself that tear was shed,</div>

       <div style="text-indent: 5em" class="indented">Which she had drunk;</div>
       <div class="l">That from my cradle to my grave,</div>
       <div class="l">I too must live a wretched slave,</div>

      <div class="lg">
       <div class="l">Her words I scarcely understood,</div>

       <div style="text-indent: 5em" class="indented">For coming years;</div>
       <div class="l">But joy with all my musings blends,</div>
       <div class="l">And infant thought not far extends</div>

       <div class="l">I ponder much to comprehend</div>

      <note xml:id="N10">Included in this play is the use of vernacular English. Vernacular English is often used to replicate the way in which people speak. Due to the lack of education of enslaved people, they would frequently talk in a more colloquial, informal language, shown in vernacular English by change words like the to “de” or mother to “mudder.” The original lines are included in order to illustrate the way in which black bodies were portrayed to the rest of the world and to examine the way in which language can prove to be a powerful portrayal of personhood. </note>
